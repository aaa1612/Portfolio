This research project attempts to apply supervised learning methods to execute Human Activity 
Recognition (HAR) in senior citizens using the HAR70+ datasets comprising of time-series data of 
participants aged between 70 and 95 years. The paper deals with the issues of identifying a number of dayto-day activities, including the problems of non-stationarity in the data gathered by sensors and class 
imbalance in the datasets. The supervised learning models used are Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), 
Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA), Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron 
(MLP), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) on individual and 
population HAR70+ data.
Key research findings showed that Random Forest has the highest accuracy score on individual
HAR70+ datasets, while RNN exerted great performance in handling population training data and poorer
performance on unseen data due to the high variability in human activities and the absence of seasonality 
in the time-series data. Resampling and averaging sampling techniques were considered optimal strategies 
for tackling the issue of class imbalance. Altogether, this research contributes to the improvement and 
development of Human Activity Recognition systems for elderly care proposing the ways of a better
functioning of supervised learning methods and selection of sampling strategies. The outline for future 
research suggestsfocusing on the extension of the deep learning algorithms and inclusive sampling methods
which consider both participants using walking assistance and the ones who do not require walking aids for 
diverse movement patterns recognition in the senior citizens HAR.
